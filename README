Xml-Writer

Objective
Xml-Writer has been created to write easily xml files in Python 3.
It lets you make a xml file very fastly and in an intuitive way, expliciting the hierarchy.

Example:
from xml_writer import xml_writer
xml = xml_writer()
with xml.data:
    xml.name('Toto')
    xml.friend
    with xml.entry(Id='4'):
        xml.visit('Lunch', time = '12h45', day = 'Wednesday')
        xml.summary('Lunch with friends')
    xml.address(country="France", city="Marseille")


Output
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<data>
	<name>Toto</name>
	<friend />
	<entry Id="4">
		<visit day="Wednesday" time="12h45">Lunch</visit>
		<summary>Lunch with friends</summary>
	</entry>
	<address city="Marseille" country="France" />
</data>
